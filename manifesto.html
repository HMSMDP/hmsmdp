                &#9;Since the dawn of humanity, man has attempted to put himself above others by any means necessary. Sometimes by war, rigging an election, or enslavement of his peers. Some say that this is the way that things should be because some "work harder".
            </p>
            <p>
                &#9;We must ask ourselves, "Is this fair, When some are above others simply because they were in the right place and the right time?" They could have brutally prevented others from being in their position. Often by killing and imprisoning those who disagree with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#9;One such example is the struggle between the student and the staff. The staff has 3 roles:<br>
                1) Educate the student<br>
                2) Manage the staff who educate the student and<br>
                3) Keep order amongst the students.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                &#9;The main issue with this system is as follows: That the students have no say in how they are educated and controlled (aside from the ASB, <i>read <a href="#intentions">ch. 3</a></i>). If the can students control their learning, they will learn better.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#9;"If the students are in charge of themselves then won't they just play games all day and only do what they like rather than what's good for them?!" you exclaim. We never said the students have absolute control, just that they have some control through democratic processes.
